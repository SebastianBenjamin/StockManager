StockManager
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pythonjango](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-3.x-green?://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-database-lightgrey?logo= is a robust inventory and stock management web application built using Python and Django.

Note: This is my first Django project.
I created StockManager to learn the Django framework and experiment with fundamental web development concepts, including models, views, templates, authentication, and integration of a relational database.

🚀 Features
Product Catalog: Add, update, and delete products with name, SKU, quantity, and price.

Inventory Tracking: Maintain accurate stock levels with real-time updates.

Purchase & Sales Management: Record and monitor stock inflows/outflows.

Search & Filter: Quickly locate products using search bars and advanced filters.

Data Persistence: All data is securely stored in an integrated SQLite database.

User-Friendly Interface: Easily navigate via Django’s default admin UI and basic templates.

Extensible Design: Easily add more fields, integrate with APIs, or expand feature set as you learn more.

StockManager follows conventional Django project structuring:
