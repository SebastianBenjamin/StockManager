> **Note:** This is my first Django project.  
I created StockManager to learn the Django framework and experiment with fundamental web development concepts, including models, views, templates, authentication, and integration of a relational database.

StockManager follows conventional Django project structuring:

```
StockManager/
│
├── inventory/         # Contains inventory app logic, models, views, templates
├── stockmanager/      # Django project settings and config files
├── db.sqlite3         # SQLite local database file (generated after migrations)
├── manage.py          # Django’s management script
└── screenshots/       # (Optional) App screenshots and images
```

- **Models:** Define data structures for products, categories, and transactions.  
- **Views:** Handle user interactions, CRUD operations, and route data to templates.  
- **Templates:** Render HTML interfaces for users and admins.  
- **Admin:** Default Django admin for backend management.
